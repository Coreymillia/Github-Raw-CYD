Device: ESP32 CYD
Purpose: text rendering, paging, and font tests.

SECTION 1 – Short lines

One
Two
Three
Four
Five
Six
Seven
Eight
Nine
Ten

SECTION 2 – Medium lines

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog again and again.
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789

SECTION 3 – Very long lines (wrap stress)

This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very long line to test how the CYD handles wrapping or clipping when the text is wider than the screen resolution.

Another extremely long line with numbers 012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 and words mixed together to force multiple wrap passes on small fonts.

SECTION 4 – Symbols and punctuation

! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] | \ : ; " ' < > , . ? /

~ `

Math style:
1 + 2 = 3
5 * 8 = 40
100 / 4 = 25
7 - 3 = 4

SECTION 5 – Brackets and formatting characters

(Parentheses)
[Square brackets]
{Curly braces}
<Angle brackets>

((Nested (parentheses inside parentheses)))

SECTION 6 – Alignment / visual scan test

|----10----|----20----|----30----|----40----|

Check if these render or show as boxes.

SECTION 9 – Paragraph scrolling test

This is a longer paragraph designed to make sure the scrolling and paging logic works correctly when more than one screen of text must be displayed on the CYD. You should be able to scroll smoothly from the beginning of this paragraph to the end without skipping lines or tearing text on screen.

Embedded systems often struggle with large buffers and dynamic text layout, so this paragraph is intentionally verbose and repetitive. Embedded systems often struggle with large buffers and dynamic text layout, so this paragraph is intentionally verbose and repetitive.

The goal here is not readability, but stability and consistency while rendering a large block of continuous text.

SECTION 10 – Blank line handling

This line appears after two blank lines.

THIS IS A TEST LINE. IF YOU SEE THIS. THEN IT WORKED.
